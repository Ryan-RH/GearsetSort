Interface for better gearset sorting

## Warning
Although it is impossible for you to accidentally delete gearsets with this, hotbars with gearsets will be scrambled as the hotbar command refers to gearsets by number. It also scrambles TPie gearsets if referred by number. I do wish to prevent this, but I am worried about being intrusive (it requires editing FFXIV config and TPie config).

I'm currently working on another plugin at the moment but made this as more of a PoC (not that its complicated).
